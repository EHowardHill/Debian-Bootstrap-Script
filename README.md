# Debian-Bootstrap-Script

A script for running on a live Linux distribution (such as Alpine), in order to install a custom Debian-based system onto your computer's hard drive of choice.

`install.sh` configures your host system. `setup-debian.sh` installs your custom distro.

From Alpine Linux, simply add `install.sh` to your `/etc/profile`, and it will run automatically on boot.
